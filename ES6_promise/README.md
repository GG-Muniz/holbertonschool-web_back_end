# ES6 Promises

This project contains exercises for working with Promises in ES6.

## Setup

- Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
- Run a file with Babel Node:
```bash
npm run dev <file>
```
- Lint files:
```bash
npm run check-lint
```
- Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## Files
- `0-promise.js` to `9-try.js`: Task implementations
- `utils.js`: Helpers used in some tasks
- `babel.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js`: Tooling configuration

All files end with a new line and use ES modules.
